# Dead or alive

Write a program to find the year when the most US presidents (former, current, or future) were alive. Also, find the names of all presidents alive at any given time. Your program must read names of the presidents and their years of life from the provided file data/presidents.txt.

See [Quora](https://www.quora.com/When-were-the-most-US-Presidents-alive) for the answer. Note that 18 presidents were alive in 1822, 1823, 1824, 1825, 1826, 1831, 1833, 1834, 1835, 1836, 1837, 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1845. If you get any of those years as an answer, you are correct.
